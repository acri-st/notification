## Introduction

### What is the Notification microservice?

The Notification microservice is a dedicated service responsible for handling all notification-related operations within the system. It provides a centralized solution for sending various types of notifications including emails, SMS, and push notifications.

**Key Features:**
- **Email Notifications**: Sends transactional and marketing emails
- **Queue-based Processing**: Uses RabbitMQ for reliable message handling
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle high-volume notification requests
- **Template Support**: Supports customizable notification templates
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitors notification delivery status


The microservice operates independently, ensuring that notification failures don't impact other system components while providing reliable delivery mechanisms for critical communications.
